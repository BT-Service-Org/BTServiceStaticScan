                The day has finally arrived! <br><br>
We’ve been planning this for months and the Salesforce Professional Services Methodology (SPSM) is now available in Beta as part of Services central... The team has migrated all of the methods that you use on a daily basis from Confluence and they can all be found here. 
<br><br>
We decided to up the content that we originally planned to migrate and now all methods have been migrated which means that you can take advantage of having all of your content in one place, having the new user experience available to you and we’ve even brought one or two Playbooks over too! 
<br><br>
During this beta, we will be seeking feedback and getting your input as we migrate the rest of the content and get ready to launch in our new home on Services Central
<br><br>
The Methodology Team will be adding more content in the coming weeks as we go through our release plan which means you’ll see more Playbooks, role-based lenses, and product offering methods as you’ve been used to in Confluence but we will be bringing in some more content and functionality as we go through FY24. 
<br><br>
 This is the start of a whole new chapter for SPSM as part of Services Central and we’re delighted to be here!
